# Club-Management-System-

Designed and developed a comprehensive web-based platform to centralize and streamline club activities at MIT Academy of Engineering. The system enables students to register/login, explore clubs, join events, and interact through discussion forums. Club leaders can manage members, post updates, and access feedback, while admins handle overall system control, event creation, and reporting. Implemented key features like event calendar, club recruitment forms, photo/video galleries, and a secure login system with role-based access. Built with React.js for a responsive frontend and Node.js/Spring Boot backend for robust performance. The project also incorporated real-time communication, secure authentication, and feedback mechanisms, aiming to increase student engagement and simplify club operations.
